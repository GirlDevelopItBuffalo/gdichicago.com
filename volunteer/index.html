                  Below is some information about getting involved with GDI as a teaching assistant or instructor. If you have additional questions, reach out to your Buffalo chapter leaders at: <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a>.

                <h3>Teaching Assistants</h3>
                <p>
                  Girl Develop It teaching assistants are awesome people who love sharing their knowledge with others and helping people one-on-one. You're not afraid of difficult questions, saying "I don't know", or Googling it. You don't have to be an expert, just an enthusiastic person with experience in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TAs are required to be present for the entire class unless otherwise requested. Note that some classes take place in a single session, while others are multiple sessions.
                </p>

                <h1 class="content-subhead">General</h1>
                <p>
                  GDI uses nationally cultivated curriculum with modifications made by each class teacher. Materials will be emailed to you a week prior to class. <em>Please be sure to review any material prior to volunteering as a teaching assistant for a course.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please note that this is an unpaid position. However, if you are heavily active as a TA or have TA'd for the same class multiple times, we encourage you to become an instructor for our chapter! See the "Teachers" section below for more details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prior to TAing for a class, review our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PdWYgpoalI6BRX4UKKK_CsX1RwDQ5uRdXb9h8HxxKQ4/edit?usp=sharing">TA Tips</a> as well. This should answer a lot of questions you may have, but always reach out to your chapter leaders if anything is unclear.
                </p>

                <h1 class="content-subhead">Onboarding</h1>
                <p>
                  To register as a TA, please email the GDI Buffalo Leadership team at <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a>. Once we receive your email, we will reach out to ask a little more about you and see what topics you're interested in. We ask that in order to officially be onboarded as a teaching assistant for GDI Buffalo, you either: <em>1) attend a TA Info Session, or 2) TA at a Code &amp; Coffee</em>. TAs are expected to be a member of the #organizers Slack channel on <a href="http://gdibuffalo.slack.com/">our local slack</a> as that is where teachers will be asking for TAs to assist them in their classes.
                </p>
                <h1 class="content-subhead">Commitment</h1>
                <ul>
                  <li>TA one class per calendar year</li>
                  <li>Provide feedback to chapter leaders on class teachers (as requested)</li>
                  <li>Take roll from class roster</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class="content-subhead">Cancellations</h1>
                <p>
                  If, for any reason, you are unable to TA your class notify your chapter leaders using the @leaders alias in the #organizers channel at least five days in advance. This will give us time to find a replacement, reschedule, or issue cancellations and refunds.

                <h3>Teachers</h3>
                <p>
                  Girl Develop It instructors are awesome people who love sharing their knowledge with others. You don't have to be an expert, just an enthusiastic person with experience in the field. Class format varies, ranging from a two-hour lecture to an eight-hour workshop format. <em>You are required to teach the entirety of the class.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At least one member of GDI staff (a leader or volunteer) will be present for your workshop to handle class and venue logistics.
                </p>

                <h1 class="content-subhead">Curriculum</h1>
                <p>
                  GDI uses nationally cultivated curriculum. Your chapter leaders will provide you with links and the Github repository for the class materials when we schedule your class. (However, all of these are publicly available on our <a href="http://www.gdibuffalo.com">website</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/gdibuffalo">Github</a>.) You may make minor changes to the curriculum, however, any substantial changes must be approved by your chapter leaders. What you teach is up to you, so please let us know your preferences (certain languages, tools, frameworks, etc).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>You are required to practice and review the material prior to teaching the course.</em> If you have any questions about the material, please notify your chapter leaders prior to the workshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you're interested in teaching new material for GDI or revamping outdated courses, we would love to work with you on this! See our <a href="http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-curriculum-site/">Teaching Materials</a> to see the status of all GDI materials.
                </p>

                      Review our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1faF9v5Lu5aYZz85_nnsCNmkfobOCTIxgvlLza5dywdw/edit?usp=sharing">Instructor Handbook</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1conBCP4G2aLxyPa-1L44YbdoasIn_EZzUBB0iAXs_7g/edit?usp=sharing">"What to expect as a GDI teacher"</a>.

                <h1 class="content-subhead">Payment</h1>
                <p>
                  GDI teachers are paid. Hooray! You will receive 40% of the student fee for the course. On the rare occasion a class is co-taught the teacher stipend is split between the two teachers. Optionally, you may choose to waive some or all of your fee and donate it back to the local chapter scholarship fund. Payment is issued by check and typically arrives 3-5 weeks after your course. If you do not receive payment in that timeframe please reach out to the Buffalo leadership team at <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a> and let us know which class you are waiting payment for.
                </p>

                </ul>

                <h1 class="content-subhead">Cancellations</h1>
                <p>
                  If, for any reason, you are unable to teach your class, you are required to notify your chapter leaders at least two weeks in advance. This will give us time to find a replacement, reschedule, or issue cancellations and refunds.
