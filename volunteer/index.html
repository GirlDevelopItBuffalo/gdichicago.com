          <h2>Teaching Assistants</h2>
          <p>
            Girl Develop It teaching assistants are awesome people who love sharing their knowledge with others and helping people one-on-one. You're not afraid of difficult questions, saying "I don't know", or Googling it. You don't have to be an expert, just an enthusiastic person with experience in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            TAs are required to be present for the entire workshop unless otherwise requested. Note that some workshops take place in a single session, while others are multiple sessions.
          </p>

          <h4>Curriculum</h4>
          <p>
            GDI uses nationally cultivated curriculum with modifications made by each class teacher. Materials will be emailed to you a week prior to class. <em>You are required to review the material prior to volunteering as a teaching assistant for the course.</em>
          </p>

          <h4>Payment</h4>
          <p>
            GDI teaching assistants are volunteers and are not paid. But we still love you! After TA'ing successfully for GDI several times, you will become eligible to take classes at a discount or for free.

          </ul>

          <h4>Cancellations</h4>
          <p>
            If, for any reason, you are unable to TA your class (or a portion of your class), you are required to notify the chapter co-leaders at least five days in advance. This will give us time to find a replacement, reschedule, or issue cancellations and refunds.
