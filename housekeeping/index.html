                <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
                <p>
                  First and foremost: all attendees of GDI Buffalo events, including classes, other meetups, hackathons, etc., are expected to abide by the <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/codeofconduct">Girl Develop It Code of Conduct</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Student Laptops</h3>
                <p>
                  Students are required to bring their own laptop for classes. If you do not have a laptop, please contact the Buffalo leadership team at <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a> before registering, and weâ€™ll see if we can work something out.
                </p>

                <h3>Scholarships</h3>
                <p>
                  We have several scholarships available for our students who are not able to cover full cost of classes. If you are interested in a scholarship, please fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/oYx2sTPelRLf5uyC3">our scholarship application</a>. You may also be interested in speaking to your employer to see if they are willing to reimburse you for the class. To discuss and for assistance with this, please reach out to the leadership team at <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Requests for Accommodations</h3>
                <p>
                  If you have accessibility requirements/requests for accommodations, please provide us with at least 2 weeks notice so we have adequate time to meet your needs. Please send requests for accommodations to our leadership team at <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>
                  Refunds are only offered if the class is cancelled, rescheduled, or moved to a different location. If you believe you may need a scholarship for a class, please request a scholarship <em>first</em> before applying to a class rather than purchasing a seat first - we cannot offer a refund or a scholarship in this case. If you can no longer attend a class that you already paid for you do have the option to offer your paid seat to another prospective student. Please let the leadership team know at <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a> if you cannot attend a class so the teachers / organizers know whether or not to expect you.
                </p>

                <h3>Course Certificates</h3>
                <p>
                  If you would like a printed course completion certificate, please email the leadership team at <a href="mailto:buffalo@girldevelopit.com">buffalo@girldevelopit.com</a> to let us know. In order to receive a printed course completion certificate you must attend at least 70% of the classes (e.g. three out of four classes for a multiday class). You will be able to pick up your requested certificate at the end of the last class. If you are unable to pick up your course certificate at class, please make arrangements to pick it up at the next Code &amp; Coffee.
                </p>

                <h3>Photography Disclosure</h3>
                <p>
                  Please be advised that photographs may be taken any events for internal use - e.g. internal GDI presentations. By attending this event, you consent that your photograph may be taken. Please reach out to the Buffalo leadership team with any questions or concerns.
                </p>

                <h3>Slack and Future Meetups</h3>
                <p>
                  If you are interested in using our GDI Buffalo Slack channel to keep in touch with your fellow classmates, other GDI Buffalo members, teachers, and TAs please <a href="https://gdibuffalo-slack.herokuapp.com/">join here</a>.
