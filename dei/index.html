              </article>

                <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
                <p>
                  First and foremost: all attendees of GDI Buffalo events, including classes, other meetups, hackathons, etc., are expected to abide by the <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/codeofconduct">Girl Develop It Code of Conduct</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>A Letter from Headquaters</h3>
                <p>
                  In October of 2018, our excecutive director sent an email to all members of Girl Develop It across the country to announce a situation that happened in a sister chapter, GDI Minneapolis, that harmed their community. (Full letter <a href="HQ-Message-2018-10-19.pdf">here</a>.) Specifically, the members of white leadership excluded a black chapter leader from chapter operations. This not only goes against our Code of Conduct, but also against the ethos that we are trying to create to serve the broader tech community. As a response to this, we as an organization and individual chapters have begun taking steps to ensure that <em>all</em> of our members, organizers, and leaders are being respected and heard.
                </p>

                <h3>DEI in Buffalo and the greater GDI community</h3>
                <p>
                  Here in Buffalo we are committed to diversity and inclusion. We believe in lifting up all people: women, non-binary adults, members of the LGBTQ community, people of all abilities, people of all races, ages, national origins, and ethnicities, and people from all educational and class backgrounds. We strive to create and foster a community that is welcome and accessible to everyone, especially people who feel excluded from traditional tech environments. We welcome everyone to our classes and events so that they can build confidence in their skill set to develop web and mobile applications, and we strive to support them in their journeys in tech.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We, both as a national organization and at the individual chapter levels, are taking steps to ensure that members of our community are both aware of the changes that are being made, as they are being made, as well as providing avenues to let us know when something falls short. Whether it be a member or an organizer, we must all work together to ensure that our community is a safe space for all who wish to enter it. We've created a chapter form that allows membership to anonymously report feedback and Code of Conduct violations to the GDI Buffalo leadership team using our <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/qrurXGdtGACkXBQs1">GDI Buffalo Code of Conduct Violation Form</a>. If you do not feel comfortable reporting directly to the local team, please use GDI HQ's <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaye-1uyGyww4MS8feqF6VAbyPT5V4YL9Q4li6xAfiwpITbg/viewform">Incident Report Form</a>. Similar to our chapter form, HQ's Incident Report Form allows you to anonymously report an indicident that you experienced or witnessed either at a GDI event or of a member of the GDI community while representing GDI.
                </p>
